# ICS3U

Python Assignment 1

This project was completed as a result of ICS3U.

The program allows the user to interact through input and performs mathematical calculations and word options through a question and answer form. It also includes various concepts taught in class like header and comments, variables and constants, operators and conversion, input, if statements, while and for loops, lists, and functions with parameters and return.

The flowchart demonstrates how these concepts are demonstrated in the program.

Python Assignment 2

The project demonstrates the following skills: for loops, functions with parameters, and assertions.

It also has exceptions, documentation, assertions, and logging. With the use of exceptions, the program does not crash even with incorrect inputs. 
All functions have the proper documentation and there are descriptive comments throughout the program. All the functions have parameters and returns with multiple 
assertions. Lastly, significant events are logged with proper detail according to the appropriate variables, returns, and inputs. Currently, the logging is disabled.
